# ThanatOS

## Information

### Project
+ Repository : [ThanatOS](https://github.com/Thanatisia/ThanatOS)

### DESCRIPTION
```
My personal linux distribution build.

I created this because I want to be able to "easily" re-create my current dotfile/build everytime I install a new distribution.


...and I may just be lazy.

The distribution I am/was using is Base ArchLinux. However, I am attempting to make the installer distro-agnostic, so a Debian build is also able to recreate the OS/install easily
```
